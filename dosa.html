    <pre>Dosa batter
Soak the ingredients:
In one bowl, soak 1½ cups regular raw rice or basmati rice along with 2 tablespoons chana dal (Bengal gram), 2 tablespoons poha (flattened rice), and ½ teaspoon fenugreek seeds (optional) in water for at least 8 hours or overnight.
In a separate bowl, soak ½ cup urad dal (skinned black gram) for about 6-8 hours or overnight.
Grind the ingredients:
Drain the water from the urad dal and grind it with ¾ to 1 cup cold filtered water to a smooth and fluffy batter. Transfer to a large bowl.
Drain the water from the rice mixture and grind it with ½ cup cold filtered water (adding more as needed) to a smooth or slightly coarse batter.
Combine both batters in a large bowl, add salt to taste, and mix well.
Ferment the batter:
Cover the bowl and allow the batter to ferment in a warm place for about 8 hours or until doubled in volume and bubbly. 
Cooking the dosa
Prepare the griddle:
Heat a cast iron pan or a non-stick skillet on medium heat. To check if it's hot enough, sprinkle a few drops of water; they should sizzle and evaporate quickly.
Lower the heat and brush the tawa lightly with oil.
Make the dosa:
Pour a ladleful of dosa batter onto the tawa and spread it outwards in a circular motion to form a thin, even circle.
Drizzle some oil or ghee around the edges and on top of the dosa.
Cook on medium heat for about 4-5 minutes, or until the bottom turns golden brown.
Gently scrape the dosa from the sides and fold it in half or roll it up.
Repeat with the remaining batter. 
Tips for crispy dosa
Ensure the tawa is properly heated before pouring the batter.
Between each dosa, wipe the pan with a wet paper towel to cool it down, allowing for easier spreading of the next dosa.
For a golden-brown dosa, be generous with oil or ghee while cooking. 
Serving suggestions
Serve the dosa hot with your favorite chutneys like coconut chutney, tomato chutney, or a spicy ginger chutney. You can also serve it with sambar or various fillings like potato masala, paneer, or mixed vegetables</pre>
