    <pre>Pani Puri Recipe

Pani Puri is a popular Indian street food snack made from crispy, hollow puris filled with a mixture of flavored water (pani), tangy tamarind chutney, spicy masala, and a savory potato or chickpea filling. It is known for its burst of sweet, sour, spicy, and salty flavors in every bite

    * **Black Salt:** 1/4 teaspoon (1g)

    * **Green Chilli:** 2 (adjust to taste)
    * **Mint Leaves:** 1/4 cup (15g)
    * **Coriander Leaves:** 1/4 cup (15g)
* **For Assembly:**
    * **Puris:** 12 to 15 (homemade or store-bought)
    * **Boondi (Fried Gram Flour Balls):** As needed (optional)

**Equipment needed:**
* Large mixing bowl
* Rolling pin
* Chapati roller or flat surface
* Cookie cutter or lid (for cutting puris)
* Deep frying pan or karahi
* Slotted spoon
* Blender or food processor
* Measuring cups and spoons
* Knife and cutting board
* Plastic sheet or dry cloth (for rolling puris)

**Instructions:**
1.  In a large bowl, combine maida, whole wheat flour, semolina, baking soda, and salt. Gradually add water while mixing to form a stiff dough, similar to the consistency used for making puris. Cover and let it rest for at least 15-30 minutes 
2.  Knead the rested dough again for a minute. Pinch off equal-sized balls of dough, roughly the size of a lemon 
3.  Using a chapati roller, roll each ball into a thin circle, about 1.5 to 2 inches in diameter. Place the rolled puris on a thick plastic sheet covered with a dry cloth to prevent sticking 
4.  Heat oil in a deep pan (kadaai) to a medium-hot temperatureâ€”hot enough to make the puris puff but not smoking  Carefully slide 3-4 puris into the hot oil at a time, using a slotted spoon to press down gently on the center and edges to encourage puffing 
5.  Once the puri puffs up, flip it over and cook until golden brown on both sides. Remove and drain on kitchen paper to remove excess oil  Allow the puris to cool completely before storing or using 
6.  For the pani, combine tamarind, water, chat masala, roasted cumin powder, black salt, and lime juice in a blender. Blend until smooth, then strain the mixture into a bowl  Add more water as needed to achieve the desired consistency and chill the pani before serving 
7.  For the filling, mash the boiled potatoes. In a separate bowl, mix the mashed potatoes with boiled chickpeas, black salt, roasted cumin powder, red chilli powder, chopped green chillies, mint leaves, and coriander leaves. Mix well and set aside 
8.  To assemble, gently crack the top of a cooled puri with your finger. Place a small amount of the potato-chickpea filling inside. Add a spoonful of tamarind chutney and a few boondi. Finally, pour in the chilled pani. Serve immediately to prevent the puri from becoming soggy 

**Safety Notes:** Use caution when handling hot oil; never leave it unattended. Ensure the oil temperature is controlled to avoid burning. Wash all fresh herbs and vegetables thoroughly before use.

**Substitutions:**
*   **Flour:** Whole wheat flour can be substituted with more maida for a lighter puri, or vice versa for a heartier texture. Some recipes use only semolina 
*   **Tamarind:** If unavailable, use 2 tablespoons of lemon juice as a substitute 
*   **Jaggery:** Can be replaced with sugar or dates for sweetness in the pani 
*   **Chickpeas:** Boiled potatoes, moong sprouts, or white peas (ragda) can be used as the filling 
*   **Boondi:** Can be omitted if not available.

**Storage:** Cooked puris can be stored in an airtight container at room temperature for up to a week  The pani can be prepared up to 24 hours in advance and chilled in the refrigerator  The potato filling can be made ahead and stored in the fridge for up to 2 days.

**Pro Tips:**
*   The key to perfect pani puri is using a stiff dough and resting it properly to make rolling easier 
*   Fry the puris in small batches to ensure they puff up evenly and don't become greasy 
*   The pani should be chilled before serving for the best flavor and texture 
*   Assemble the pani puri just before eating to maintain the crispiness of the puri </pre>
